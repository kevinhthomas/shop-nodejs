# shop-nodejs

A simple Node.js shop using view templates and MongoDB. Follows a Udemy class.
<br/>
Requires installation of Node.js (v12.14.1) and a working MongoDB Cluster. Uses Mongoose ODM for DB interaction and EJS for templating.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently needs to be supplied with a user/pass and URL to MongoDB cluster (server.js). Will automatically set up a default user upon starting up the server.
<br/>
To start, in command line, navigate to root directory of project and run:
<br/>
<code>npm install</code>
<br/>
<code>npm run dev-start</code>
<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards, you can reach it by going to: http://localhost:3000/
